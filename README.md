# Next.js Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when fetching data within a Next.js component.  The problem is that the component renders the placeholder 'undefined' before the asynchronous data fetch operation is complete. This issue is quite common with `fetch` and similar asynchronous operations when not handled properly.

## Problem Description:

The `pages/about.js` component attempts to display data fetched from an API endpoint (`/api/slow`). However, because the `fetch` call is asynchronous, the component initially renders before the data is retrieved, leading to the display of 'undefined'.

## Solution:

The solution involves utilizing `async/await` or promises effectively to ensure the data is loaded before rendering.  This prevents the display of 'undefined` as the component will wait for the asynchronous operation to resolve.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the initial display of 'undefined' before the actual data appears after a delay.
